        <p>The Otherworldly aurora borealis, or the northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere- at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles- when charged particles from the sun become trapped  in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful dancing light show.</p>
        <p>The first time I filmed an aurora from an icebreaker near Antartica.</p>
